## CPP_Programs

Hello Every One !
 
 
   In this Repo I am uploading the Cpp Program that we have done. These are the small programs ,but very useful program.  

   C++ is a general-purpose programming language created by Danish computer scientist Bjarne Stroustrup as an extension of the C programming language, or 
   <b>"C with Classes"<b>. The language has expanded significantly over time, and modern C++ now has object-oriented, generic, and functional features in addition
   to facilities for low-level memory manipulation. It is almost always implemented as a compiled language, and many vendors provide C++ compilers, including the Free 
   Software Foundation, LLVM, Microsoft, Intel, Oracle, and IBM, so it is available on many platforms.
